What are Insertions & Deletions in Git?
eg. 2 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 11 deletions(-)
A. It is just number of lines inserted and number of lines deleted in that particular commit. Note that a modified line maybe treated as an insert and a delete.

why does git have a staging area?
why not directly commit?
why first add,then commit
